Replicate these findings with the training data \\
Run descriptive statistics to examine outcomes
Run the regressionsâ€”look at sample sizes in Bailey et al. (2020) and in this set of results

Run the analysis with the full sample
Are the descriptive stats the same as in the case of training data? If not, why?
What sample is reasonable?
What other restrictions make sense?
What flags are necessary?
What other quirks do you see in the descriptive statistics or regression results? Are there outliers?
What weights would you use?
How do the results differ across training and full samples? How do the results differ by state?

What are IGE for education by sex? For girls and their fathers? Girls and their mothers? Boys and their mothers? How do these estimates differ from the IGE for education for boys and their fathers? Boys with both mothers and fathers education in regression? Girls with both mothers and fathers education in regression? What are the sibling correlations?
How are the results different by sex?
